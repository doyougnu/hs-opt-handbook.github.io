`Cardano-Ledger: Performance Regression from GHC-8.10.7 to GHC-9.2.8`
=====================================================================

This chapter is a case study on a performance regression in the |c-l| code base
that IOG observed when upgrading the code base from |old| to |new|. To root
cause the performance regression this case study directly inspects the
:ref:`Core <Reading Core>` and uses the GHC :ref:`Profiler <GHC Flags>`. After
reading this chapter, one should be able to spot inefficient Core, understand
the difference and use cases for |inline|, |inlineable| and |spec| pragmas.

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. We introduce evidence of the
performance regression. From this information we choose candidates to inspect as
leads in our investigation. TODO :math:`\ldots{}`


Evidence of a Regression
------------------------

The regression was first observed in an integration test performed by the
Cardano-Perf team which resulted in two GHC Profiles:
