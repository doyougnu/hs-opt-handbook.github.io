The Spineless Tagless G-machine
===============================

In the previous chapter we argued that in order to debug, one must :ref:`Know
the System`. In pursuit of this, this chapter presents the Spineless
Tagless G-machine (STG machine), as described by :cite:t:`fastCurry`. We focus
on presenting the abstract machine and how it is mapped to hardware. This is
required background for any who are serious about writing fast, highly optimized
Haskell. Knowing the operational semantics of the STG machine will enable one to
understand the upcoming chapters on :ref:`Reading Cmm` and :ref:`Reading STG`
and ....
